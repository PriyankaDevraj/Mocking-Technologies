	<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
		<li><strong>Definition</strong>-Mockito is a mocking framework,
			JAVA-based library that is used for effective unit testing of JAVA
			applications. Mockito is used to mock interfaces so that a dummy
			functionality can be added to a mock interface that can be used in
			unit testing.</li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Main Features</strong>-– Mocks concrete classes as
			well as interfaces, supports annotations, allows flexible
			verification in order, supports exception.</li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Integration with JUnit</strong>-– Mockit can be
			integrated with JUnit for unit
			testing.@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) implies that JUnit will be
			attached to mockit runner for testing.@InjectMocks annotation is used
			to identify class which is going to use the mock object.@Mock creates
			the mock object to be injected for testing.We can also use mock()
			method to create a mock object. This is shown in example 1 <a
			href="code/MathAppTesterMockito.java">Example</a> <a
			href="code/MathAppTesterMockito1.java">Example 1</a></li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Test and Behavior Driven Development support</strong>--The
			behavior to be tested can be added using "when" and "thenReturns".It
			also supports a given, when and then test structure. These are
			demonstrated in example 2 and example 3. <a
			href="Code/MathAppTesterMockito.java">Example 2</a> <a
			href="Code/MathAppTesterMockito1.java">Example 3</a></li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Verify method</strong>--Mockito can ensure whether a
			mock method is being called with required arguments or not.We can
			also verify the exact number of times a behavior is tested using
			times(). We can check whether a behavior was tested as least once,
			never or at max a specified number.There is also a timeout feature
			which we can mention in verify which verifies whether a test executes
			within the specified time. These features are used in examples
			mentioned. <a href="Code\MathAppTesterMockito.java">Example 2</a> <a
			href="Code\MathAppTesterMockito1.java">Example 3</a></li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Exception Handling Using Mockito</strong>--Using
			doThrow and when we can test exception with Mockito. In the test
			class we need to mention the expected exception which is being
			thrown. <a href="Code\MockitoExceptionDemo.java">Example 4</a></li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>The InOrder class</strong>--This class helps us
			define a order in which the behaviors should be tested. If the order
			is different, test fails. This is done by instantiating the class
			InOrder and then doing inOrder.verify as shown in below example.<a
			href="Code\MathAppTesterMockito1.java">Example</a></li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>The Answer interface</strong>--Mockito provides a
			Answer interface which allows stubbing with generic interface.<a
			href="Code\MathAppTesterMockito1.java">Example</a></li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>spy and reset</strong>--Use of spy helps us access
			the original object instance and the reset object resets the mock
			object.<a href="Code\MathAppTesterMockito1.java">Example</a></li>
