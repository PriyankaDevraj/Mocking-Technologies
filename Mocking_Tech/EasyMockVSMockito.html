		1. Both provide same level of verification.<br>
		<br> 2. Both have argument matchers.<br>
		<br> 3. There is no replay in Mockito. The behavior is ready to
		test.<br>
		<br> 4. All mocks are nice in Mockito while in EasyMock it has to
		be specifically mentioned.<br>
		<br> 5. Better readability of code in Mockito.<br>
		<br> 6. Call of stubbed methods can be made any number of times
		in Mockito which is not the case in EasyMock.<br>
		<br> 7. In Mockito verification is done for method arguments and
		returned values which in EasyMock verification is done for the created
		mock.<br>
		<br>
		<h2><b><i>EasyMock, Mockito versus PowerMock</i></b></h2>
		1. PowerMock extends other EasyMock and Mockito with more powerful capabilities.<br><br>
		2. PowerMock features can be applied in combination with EasyMock or Mockito.<br><br>
