	<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
		<li><strong>Definition</strong>-EasyMock is an open-source
			testing framework for Java released under the Apache License. The
			framework allows the creation of test double objects for the purpose
			of Test-driven Development (TDD) or Behavior Driven Development
			(BDD).</li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Main Features</strong>-– Mocks concrete classes as
			well as interfaces, supports annotations, with Strict mock order of
			method execution can be checked, supports exception.</li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Integration with JUnit</strong>-– EasyMock can be
			integrated with JUnit for unit testing.@RunWith(EasyMockRunner.class)
			implies that JUnit will be attached to EasyMock runner for
			testing.@TestSubjectannotation is used to identify class which is
			going to use the mock object.@Mock creates the mock object to be
			injected for testing.We can also use createMock() method to create a
			mock object. This is shown in example 1 <a
			href="code/TestMathApplication.java">Example</a> <a
			href="code/PortfolioTester.java">Example 1</a></li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Test and Behavior Driven Development support</strong>--The
			behavior to be tested can be added using "EasyMock.expect" and
			"andReturn".It is not activated until EasyMock.replay() is executed.
			<a href="code/TestMathApplication.java">Example 2</a></li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Verify method</strong>--Easymock can ensure whether a
			mock is used or not using EasyMock.verify().It can also verify the
			number of calls to a method using
			EasyMock.expectLastCall().times().It also provides
			times(min,max),atLeastOnce,anyTimes methods to verify number of
			calls. <a href="code/TestMathApplication.java">Example</a></li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Exception Handling in EasyMock</strong>--Using Expect
			and andThrow exception can be handled in EasyMock. In the test class
			we need to mention the expected exception which is being thrown. <a
			href="code/TestMathApplication.java">Example 4</a></li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>createStrictMock and createNiceMock</strong>--EasyMock.createStrictMock()
			creates a mock and also takes care of the order of method calls that
			the mock is going to make in due course of its action.
			EasyMock.createNiceMock() creates a mock and sets the default
			implementation of each method of the mock. If EasyMock.createMock()
			is used, then invoking the mock method throws assertion error.<a
			href="code/TestMathApplication.java">Example</a></li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>replayAll, verifyAll and resetAll</strong>--replayAll()
			– Registers all the created mocks in one batch. verifyAll() –
			Verifies all the mock operations in one batch. resetAll() – Resets
			all the mock operations in one batch.<a
			href="code/TestMathApplication.java">Example</a></li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>spy and reset</strong>--Use of spy helps us access
			the original object instance and the reset object resets the mock
			object.<a href="code/TestMathApplication.java">Example</a></li>
